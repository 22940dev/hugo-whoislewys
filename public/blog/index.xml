      <description>What follows is an exact repost/mirror of Steve Yegge&amp;rsquo;s 2012 post &amp;ldquo;Notes from the Mystery Machine Bus&amp;rdquo; from Google+ on the software risk aversion axis. It&amp;rsquo;s not even accessible from the WaybackMachine. Enjoy.
Notes from the Mystery Machine Bus I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the past eight years (starting back in June 2004) writing elaborate rants about a bunch of vaguely related software engineering issues.
I was doing all that ranting because I&amp;rsquo;ve been genuinely perplexed by a set of &amp;ldquo;bizarre&amp;rdquo; world-views held dear by &amp;ndash; as far as I can tell &amp;ndash; about half of all programmers I encounter, whether online or in person.</description>

      <title>Why FFmpeg Loudness &amp; Normalization Guides Are All Wrong, Evil &amp; Immoral!</title>

      <description>The Wrong Way There are SEVERAL guides online telling you how to normalize audio to provide a great listening experience by using FFmpeg’s &amp;ldquo;loudnorm&amp;rdquo; filter. Most walk you through a simple process called &amp;ldquo;track normalization.&amp;rdquo; You set a goal loudness, and adjust every piece of audio up or down to match that loudness. This is evil and immoral and I’ll tell you why:
Loudnorm changes the way things sound!
Loudnorm crushes dynamics!</description>

      <title>The Only 4 Deep Learning Frameworks That Matter</title>

      <description>Let me get this off my chest right off the bat: Keras is all you need for 90% of neural network tasks. Before jumping in, you should understand what is going on with neural networks(watch 3Blue1Brown&amp;rsquo;s videos).
Ideally, you can understand all the math behind them and code a basic one from scratch (read Nielsen&amp;rsquo;s Neural Networks and Deep Learning).
But for most cases, even understanding is unnecessary with all the pretrained models frameworks ship with nowadays.</description>

      <title>How I Built My Own Guitar</title>
      <link>https://whoislewys.com/2018/06/25/building-my-own-guitar/</link>

      <description>Why? I wanted a faster, more efficient way to make music.
My solution? Stick a Launchpad in a guitar
Sadly, no electric guitars I found had the room for a launchpad.
My solution (pt 2)? Build my own guitar with correct dimensions.
My advice? DON&amp;rsquo;T DO IT. It was really hard and time consuming.
Unless you NEED to do this to get specific dimensions &amp;amp; realize some crazy idea of your own, just buy a nice used guitar.</description>
