      <description>Let me get this off my chest right off the bat: Keras is all you need for 90% of neural network tasks. Before jumping in, you should understand what is going on with neural networks(watch 3Blue1Brown&amp;rsquo;s videos).
Ideally, you can understand all the math behind them and code a basic one from scratch (read Nielsen&amp;rsquo;s Neural Networks and Deep Learning).
But for most cases, even understanding is unnecessary with all the pretrained models frameworks ship with nowadays.</description>
