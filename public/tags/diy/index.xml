      <description>The Wrong Way There are SEVERAL guides online telling you how to normalize audio to provide a great listening experience by using FFmpeg’s &amp;ldquo;loudnorm&amp;rdquo; filter. Most walk you through a simple process called &amp;ldquo;track normalization.&amp;rdquo; You set a goal loudness, and adjust every piece of audio up or down to match that loudness. This is evil and immoral and I’ll tell you why:
Loudnorm changes the way things sound!
Loudnorm crushes dynamics!</description>

      <title>How I Built My Own Guitar</title>

      <description>Why? I wanted a faster, more efficient way to make music.
My solution? Stick a Launchpad in a guitar
Sadly, no electric guitars I found had the room for a launchpad.
My solution (pt 2)? Build my own guitar with correct dimensions.
My advice? DON&amp;rsquo;T DO IT. It was really hard and time consuming.
Unless you NEED to do this to get specific dimensions &amp;amp; realize some crazy idea of your own, just buy a nice used guitar.</description>
