      <description>What follows is an exact repost/mirror of Steve Yegge&amp;rsquo;s 2012 post &amp;ldquo;Notes from the Mystery Machine Bus&amp;rdquo; from Google+ on the software risk aversion axis. It&amp;rsquo;s not even accessible from the WaybackMachine. Enjoy.
Notes from the Mystery Machine Bus I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the past eight years (starting back in June 2004) writing elaborate rants about a bunch of vaguely related software engineering issues.
I was doing all that ranting because I&amp;rsquo;ve been genuinely perplexed by a set of &amp;ldquo;bizarre&amp;rdquo; world-views held dear by &amp;ndash; as far as I can tell &amp;ndash; about half of all programmers I encounter, whether online or in person.</description>

      <description>Let me get this off my chest right off the bat: Keras is all you need for 90% of neural network tasks. Before jumping in, you should understand what is going on with neural networks(watch 3Blue1Brown&amp;rsquo;s videos).
Ideally, you can understand all the math behind them and code a basic one from scratch (read Nielsen&amp;rsquo;s Neural Networks and Deep Learning).
But for most cases, even understanding is unnecessary with all the pretrained models frameworks ship with nowadays.</description>
