## Compressor Cheatsheet
For YEARS I struggled with using compression properly, messing with knobs 'till I got lucky. I read so many posts online and watch advanced tutorials on YouTube that confused me even more.

But when I buckled down and learned how compressors really work, one knob at a time, and got a feel for it, my mixes got light years better.

And I condensed all that knowledge into ONE cheatsheet, so that you don't have to go through the same pain. It's designed to teach you intuitively what each knob does, so you get a feel for how compression works instead of worrying about nerdy details.

## Reverb Cheatsheet
Reverb is so tough to get right.

Tuning reverb settings to sound just right gets SO much easier when you know a little about what the knobs do.

I got the feel for it from hours and hours of reading forum posts and wikipedia and recreating reverb tones from dozens of tracks.

And I boiled all that knowledge down into a single page, just for you, you beautiful stranger.
