## Project Overview:
#### Lots of places in the developing world have extremely limited data access. But they can text. 

GText used the Twilio SMS API to send location requests to Google maps, and return directions to the user.

This enables those with even the poorest connections to find directions to any place they can dream of. (In case they forgot a map, have never been to a certain place and want to know how far it is, etc.)

This project won the Google Prize at Hack Arizona 2019, which consisted of GPoints (or whatever they call that internal scoring mechanism they use to evaluate college candidates for jobs), Google Homes, and clout.
