## Project Overview:
#### Connecting Financial Processes

"Make life easier with reports that write themselves.

Our hardworking platform automates repetitive tasks, orchestrates workflows, and turns your data and reports into reusable assets. Never start from scratch again."


## What I did:
* Worked in a team of 4 to release a full-stack microservice to production in Workivaâ€™s flagship product (Wdesk) using Java, Dart, React, and MySQL
* Use agile development processes to plan, develop, test, and release new features and improvements to the attachments, comments, history, and digital review experiences
* Maintain, refactor, and add new features to existing codebases at scale in Go, Java, and React
* Utilize modern cloud tooling like AWS EC2 and Docker


## Fun Facts:
* Ticker: $WK
* I got addicted to vim while working here thanks to my colleague Pat. Hell, I'm writing this post in vim right now.
* I also got addicted to Smash Bros while working here. We'd play Smash Ultimate sometimes on breaks. My Game & Watch is nasty. (in Melee, too)
* 80% of the Fortune 500 is a Workiva customer
* Workiva was one of the first companies to use Dart in production
