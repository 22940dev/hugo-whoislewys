Just as Paul Graham wished to be an artiste and tricked himself into settling for non-creative, pizza grease-stained technology, so have I.
But here's some cool posters I made anyways, to teach people how to use an audio effect called compression. (I got a bit obsessed with mix engineering midway thru high school)

The compression sheet is STILL the top all time post on the `r/edmproduction` subreddit (as of Feb9, 2021). After reaching ATH and several people asking me to sell them one, I got banned for building a shop and posting a link. I am convinced this was my peak.
