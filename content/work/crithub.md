#### A critique platform for creatives to give, receive, & collect feedback.

## Project Overview

Millions of underground musicians are not able to easily move through the creative process because the review of music in development is made hard by a feeling of isolation within the creative ecosystem. Our number one goal with this project was to make the ideation, production, and testing of creative work easier for both underground and established musicians.

> â€œAs an artist, I try to grow through feedback and listen to it. I Use social media to find people I want feedback from, or send songs through e-mail & group texts to my crew" - Derrick
