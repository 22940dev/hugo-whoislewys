## Project Overview:
tekr is a quiz designed to help you discover if you are a conservative or liberal programmer. This has NOTHING to do with politics whatsoever - just risk aversion.

It does say a surprising amount about who you work well with, though.

It is based on a post by the prolific Steve Yegge, mirrored [here](/2019/09/06/notes-from-the-mystery-machine_bus/).

The project lives on [tekr.dev](https://tekr.dev).


## What I did:
