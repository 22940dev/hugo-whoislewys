#### A new way to discover underground music.
> note: ah yes, the days of skipping calculus 2, to learn calculus 3 (partial integrals), to write a better neural net, to try and give the best music recommendations in the world.


## Project Overview
Discovering new underground music is painful because you have to spend a lot of time listening to bad music before finding a single good song. Our goal with this project was to make it trivial to find new music by new musicians that you could fall in love with.

We were successful in helping over 40,000 listeners from around the world discover amazing new music. We also helped more than 500 hundred talented artists get their music discovered. Plus, we had a 4.7 star rating averaged across the iOS and Google Play stores!
